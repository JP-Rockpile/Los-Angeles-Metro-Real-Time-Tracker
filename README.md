# Los-Angeles-Metro-Real-Time-Tracker

Real Time Metro Tracker

This app works with the Map Box and LA metro APIs. Upon clicking "show metro rail car locations" the map updates with all locations of current rail cars in the LA area. The app updates the location of the rail cars automatically every 15 seconds. 

Roadmap of future improvements: Future improvements will include updating the map with all metro line path ways and metro stops in addition to real time metro locations.
